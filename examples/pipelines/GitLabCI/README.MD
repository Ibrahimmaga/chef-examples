# HowTo - GitLabCI Pipeline examples

This document contains example files and GitLabCI specific instructions. While these examples should be functional and directly consumable, they are not exhaustive and only provide the minimum recommended steps. The author's expectation is that consumers will use these examples to get started then tailor them as needed in a continuous improvement fashion.

## Before You Start
