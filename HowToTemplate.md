# Chef-Examples HowTo Template

This template is pretty straight forward, when creating a new example, be sure to do the following:

1. Fork the repo.
1. Copy this template file into the `/examples` directory and give it a unique, succinct name. Please follow the `CaMeLcAsE` format that this file uses, and make sure the filename always starts with the Chef product (eg. `Chef|Habitat|InSpec|Automate`). A full example would be something like this: `ChefRoleCookbookModel.md`.
1. Make sure to follow the template below, and provide any information that is marked as [required], be sure to delete any unnecessary text (**including the opening and closing "[]" as well as everything from this line and above**) prior to making your PR.
